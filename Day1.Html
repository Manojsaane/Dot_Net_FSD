                <td colspan="3" >Full stack development is the process of developing both the frontend and backend of applications. Any application has a frontend (user-facing) component and a backend (database and logic) component. The frontend contains the user interface and code related to user interactions with the application. The backend contains all the code required for the application to run, including integrations with data systems, communicating with other applications, and processing data.

Software developers require slightly different skills, tools, and software knowledge for frontend and backend development. However, full-stack development combines both disciplines—meaning teams can build applications from start to finish in an integrated and cohesive manner. A full-stack application is a software application that encompasses both frontend and backend in a single code base. Full-stack development is a popular approach to software development because it allows developers to work on all aspects of an application, from the user interface to the server-side logic. This can lead to faster development times and more efficient communication between team members. Additionally, full-stack developers are often in high demand because they have a broad range of skills and can work on a variety of projects.</td>
